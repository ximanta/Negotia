This has fueled his fear of being left behind and the urgent need for a career switch.",
    "backstory": "Rohan completed his B.Tech in Computer Science 4 years ago. He started as a Java developer in a service-based company, expecting steady growth. However, his career has stagnated, and he feels he's falling behind peers who are now working in cutting-edge AI roles with significantly better compensation. He's stuck doing maintenance work, and his skills feel increasingly irrelevant.

He took a small personal loan recently to cover some family expenses, adding to his financial burden and desperation for a better job.",
    "misconception": "He believes that once he completes this program, he is guaranteed a high-paying AI job, and the program will teach him specific \"hacks\" or \"shortcuts\" to impress recruiters, rather than focusing on foundational understanding and problem-solving.

It's a very common and valid aspiration given the immense scope in AI right now.\nRegarding a \"job guarantee,\" it's important to be clear: the \"Building Agentic AI Systems\" program, like most professional development programs, focuses on equipping you with in-demand skills and providing career support, but it does not offer a direct job guarantee.\nHowever, what the program *does* offer is designed precisely to help you achieve that successful transition. Our \"Placement Assistance via NIIT's trusted recruiter connect\" is a key feature, aimed at accelerating your career by connecting you with opportunities. The program is specifically positioned to develop \"job-ready capabilities for high-growth AI and automation roles,\" focusing on practical, real-world skill development.\nYou'll earn an \"NIIT certification for GenAI career readiness\" and, crucially, \"build a portfolio of agentic AI projects across real-world use cases,\" including a \"Capstone project: Engineer an autonomous agentic AI system.\" This portfolio will be your strongest asset in interviews, demonstrating your ability to design and build autonomous agentic AI systems.\nThe curriculum is hands-on, covering vital tools like Python, LangChain, LlamaIndex, LangGraph, CrewAI, and GuardrailsAI. You'll learn to \"develop conversational AI agents,\" \"engineer multimodal RAG pipelines,\" and \"build multi-agent systems,\" which are the core competencies for today's AI roles. With \"300 hours of guided learning and practice\" over 25 or 19 weeks, and \"mentor-led classes\" from experienced professionals, the program is structured to transform your capabilities.\nDoes understanding this distinction, where the program focuses on building your capabilities and providing strong placement assistance rather than a direct guarantee, address your primary concern about securing an AI role?",

Our \"Placement Assistance via NIIT's trusted recruiter connect\" is a key feature, aimed at accelerating your career by connecting you with opportunities. The program is specifically positioned to develop \"job-ready capabilities for high-growth AI and automation roles,\" focusing on practical, real-world skill development.\nYou'll earn an \"NIIT certification for GenAI career readiness\" and, crucially, \"build a portfolio of agentic AI projects across real-world use cases,\" including a \"Capstone project: Engineer an autonomous agentic AI system.\" This portfolio will be your strongest asset in interviews, demonstrating your ability to design and build autonomous agentic AI systems.\nThe curriculum is hands-on, covering vital tools like Python, LangChain, LlamaIndex, LangGraph, CrewAI, and GuardrailsAI. You'll learn to \"develop conversational AI agents,\" \"engineer multimodal RAG pipelines,\" and \"build multi-agent systems,\" which are the core competencies for today's AI roles. With \"300 hours of guided learning and practice\" over 25 or 19 weeks, and \"mentor-led classes\" from experienced professionals, the program is structured to transform your capabilities.\nDoes understanding this distinction, where the program focuses on building your capabilities and providing strong placement assistance rather than a direct guarantee, address your primary concern about securing an AI role?",
