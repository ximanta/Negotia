Could you perhaps elaborate on what a \"Front Engineer\" entails in this context?\nRegarding the 70% score eligibility, I noted that directly from the programme details you sent over. Specifically, under \"placement support details,\" it states: \"Placement assistance is available for eligible learners (70% score, regular graduation degree, India resident).\" My query was really about whether the impressive 95% placement success rate applies to *all* enrolled students, or only those who meet these specific, strict eligibility and activity criteria, including the 70% score. I just want to ensure I fully understand the *placement outcomes* and what's genuinely guaranteed.",

The roles like AI Engineer and RAG Engineer also align with what I'm looking for. But \"Front Engineer\"? Is that like a frontend developer, or something specific to AI? I need to clarify that.\n\nAnd honestly, I'm a bit miffed. I explicitly mentioned the 70% score criteria for placement eligibility directly from the programme details, and now they're asking where I got it from? Did they even read what I said? It makes me question how much attention they're paying. This is about *my career progression* and *return on investment*, so I need precise answers, not to be questioned about information *they've* provided. It adds to my worry that there might be hidden catches or that they're not fully across their own terms. I need to gently but firmly point out where I got that information and get proper clarification on the placement guarantee. My primary concern about job security is still very much active.",

What if I don't achieve 70%? Does that mean I'm essentially excluded from the placement support that the 95% figure is based on? This feels like a huge risk. I need to be more direct.

This is exactly why I'm so worried. I need concrete answers, not rhetorical questions that make me doubt myself. This feels like they're hiding something or making excuses. My fear of not being smart enough is really kicking in. I can't afford to invest this much money if the job guarantee is so conditional and unclear.
